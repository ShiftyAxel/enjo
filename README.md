enjo
====

A port of the Mojo user interface elements to Enyo2. Currently very much a WIP.

Concept
====

In order to avoid open-source closed-source issues, enjo will use file paths to the Mojo UI elements in the webOS rootfs.

This means enjo will only work on webOS Devices with the Mojo framework installed, but it avoids the problem of publishing closed-source software elements.

Progress

Palm-Button: Reskin an enyo button, will have to figure out how to slice the graphic without modifying it
